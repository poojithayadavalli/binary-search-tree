Rohan is learning about trees and he want to test his knowledge on trees by constructing a BinarySearch Tree
from the list which contains the following:
a)the elements in the list are the pairs of numbers whose sum is equal to n in soreted order
b)the list do not contain duplicate numbers and negative numbers if exists then ignore

Contraints:
	2<=n<=10000
input format:
 	first line contains array of numbers
 	second line contains number n
output format:
 	inorder traversal of BinarySearch Tree

Example:
input:
3 4 5
9
output:
4 5

input:
3 3 4 2 1
6
output:
3 2 4
